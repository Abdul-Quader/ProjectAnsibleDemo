Ansible is a configuration management automation tool for IT tasks. It is an open-source, cross-platform tool for resource provisioning automation that DevOps professionals popularly use for continuous delivery of software code by taking advantage of an “infrastructure as code” approach. 

It is popular and widely accepted, because

•	Configuration/Installation/Deployment using single YAML file.
•	Re-using same file multiple times for different environments.
•	It is agent less system more reliable and less likely for errors.
